laptop-mode-tools (1.43-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 1.43:
    * Don't use temp file in init script, that doesn't work if /tmp is
      mounted readonly. Closes: #480946.
    * Fix IPW2100 power management so that power management mode stays

      installations. Closes: #482307.
