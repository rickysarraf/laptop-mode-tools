  * [847ad92] Update README.md
  * [b864b5d] Add verbose message on top of Matthias's change
  * [49bdb7f] On startup, we want to force the full execution of LMT.
    Because there could be many devices that discover slow. From them,
    this invocation will have given enough time to initialize.
    Secondly, LMT could have been invoked way too early during boot,
    by udev. In such cases, we'd have enough delta for it to act in
    force mode
  * [f4d6b93] auto only takes care of power state changes. Device
    hotplugs need a forced execution for LMT to apply the proper
    settings

    brightness. Thanks to Roman V. Nikolaev (github/rshadow)
