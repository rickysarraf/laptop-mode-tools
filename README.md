* The laptop mode FAQ can be found at <https://github.com/rickysarraf/laptop-mode-tools/wiki/FAQ>

* The revision history is included in the `Documentation` directory.

* The original laptop mode documentation that was distributed with the Linux
  kernel is included in this package as `Documentation/laptop-mode.txt`. It
  contains some documentation on the internals of laptop mode, and some tips
  and tricks. Note that some of the tips are outdated and superseded by FAQ
  questions.
