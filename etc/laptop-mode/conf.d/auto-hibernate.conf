# Auto-hibernation settings
# -------------------------
#
# Using these settings, you can make laptop mode tools automatically put your
# computer into hibernation when the battery level goes critically low.
#
# This feature only works on ACPI, and only works on computers whose batteries
# give off battery events often enough.
#
# NOTE: If your battery does NOT give off battery events often enough, you can
# enable the battery-level-polling module to make this work after all. See
# battery-level-polling.conf for more information.
#
#
# IMPORTANT: In versions 1.36 and earlier, these settings were included in the
# main laptop-mode.conf configuration file. If they are still present, they
# overrule the settings in this file. To fix this, simply delete the settings
# from the main config file.
