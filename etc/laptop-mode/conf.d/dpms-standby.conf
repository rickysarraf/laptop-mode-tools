# X display settings
# ------------------
#
# Using these settings, you can let laptop mode tools control the X display
# standby timeouts.
#
# This requires that you have installed the "xset" utility. It is part of the
# X.org server distribution and included in the package xorg-server-utils.
#
# The X settings are not automatically applied on login, and this is
# impossible fix for the user, since laptop mode tools must operate as root.
# The laptop-mode.conf(8) manual page section on the CONTROL_DPMS_STANDBY
# setting describes a workaround for this limitation.
#
#
# IMPORTANT: In versions 1.36 and earlier, these settings were included in the
# main laptop-mode.conf configuration file. If they are still present, they
# overrule the settings in this file. To fix this, simply delete the settings
# from the main config file.

# larger values derived from these values.
