# Configuration for Laptop Mode Tools
# -----------------------------------
#
# There is a "system" to the configuration setting names:
#    CONTROL_something=0/1   Determines whether Laptop Mode Tools controls 
#                            something
#    LM_something=value      Value of "something" when laptop mode is active
#    NOLM_something=value    Value of "something" when laptop mode is NOT
#                            active
#    AC_something=value      Value of "something" when the computer is running
#                            on AC power
#    BATT_something=value    Value of "something when the computer is running
#                            on battery power
#
# There can be combinations of LM_/NOLM_ and AC_/BATT_ prefixes, but the
# available prefixes are different for each setting. The available ones are 
# documented in the manual page, laptop-mode.conf(8). If there is no LM_/
# NOLM_ in a setting name, then the value is used independently of laptop
# mode state, and similarly, if there is no AC_/BATT_, then the value is used
# independently of power state.
#
# Some options only work on ACPI systems. They are marked ACPI-ONLY.
#
# Note that this configuration file is a fragment of shell script: you
# can use all the features of the shell scripting language to achieve your
# desired configuration.
#
# 
# Modules
# -------
#
# Laptop Mode Tools modules have separate configuration files, that can be
# found in /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d. Please look through these configuration
# files as well, there are many useful power saving tools in there!

# When to enable laptop mode
# --------------------------
#
# "Laptop mode" is the mode in which laptop mode tools makes the computer
# consume less power. This includes the kernel "laptop_mode" feature, which
# allows your hard drives to spin down, as well as various other settings which
# can be tweaked by laptop mode tools. You can enable or disable all of these
# settings using the CONTROL_... options further down in this config file.

#
# Enable laptop mode when on battery power.
#
ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_BATTERY=1


#
# Enable laptop mode when on AC power.
#
ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_ON_AC=0


#
# Enable laptop mode when the laptop's lid is closed, even when we're on AC
# power? (ACPI-ONLY)
#
ENABLE_LAPTOP_MODE_WHEN_LID_CLOSED=0


#
# Enable all simple zero-configuration auto modules
# This option enables all simple modules (listed below) without requiring
# the user to enable each module individually
#
# List of modules which can be automatically enabled with this setting are:
#
# ac97-powersave
# cpufreq
# dpms-standby
# eee-superhe
# ethernet
# exec-commands
# hal-polling

# NOTE: You can explicitly enable/disable any of the above modules by changing their
# values in the individual settings file

###############################################################################
# When to enable data loss sensitive features
# -------------------------------------------
#
# When data loss sensitive features are disabled, laptop mode tools acts as if
# laptop mode were disabled, for those features only.
#
# Data loss sensitive features include:
# - laptop_mode (i.e., delayed writes)
# - hard drive write cache
#
# All of the options that follow can be set to 0 in order to prevent laptop
# mode tools from using them to stop data loss sensitive features. Use this
# when you have a battery that reports the wrong information, that confuses
# laptop mode tools.
#
# Disabling data loss sensitive features is ACPI-ONLY, and it only works if
# your battery gives off frequent ACPI events to indicate a change in battery
# level.
#
# NOTE: If your battery does NOT give off battery events often enough, you can
# enable the battery-level-polling module to make this work. Look at the
# file /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/battery-level-polling.conf for more information.
#

#
# Disable all data loss sensitive features when the battery level (in % of the
# battery capacity) reaches this value.

###############################################################################
# Controlled hard drives and partitions
# -------------------------------------
#
# For spinning down your hard drives, laptop mode will remount file systems and
# adjust hard drive spindown timeouts. These parameters specify which
# devices and partitions are affected by laptop mode.
###############################################################################


#
# The drives that laptop mode controls.
# Separate them by a space, e.g. HD="/dev/hda /dev/hdb". The default is a
# wildcard, which will get you all your IDE and SCSI/SATA drives.
#
HD="/dev/[hs]d[abcdefgh]"


#
# The partitions (or mount points) that laptop mode controls.
# Separate the values by spaces. Use "auto" to indicate all partitions on drives
# listed in HD. You can add things to "auto", e.g. "auto /dev/hdc3". You can
# also specify mount points, e.g. "/mnt/data".
#
PARTITIONS="auto /dev/mapper/*"


#
# If this is enabled, laptop mode tools will assume that SCSI drives are
# really SATA drives that only _look_ like SCSI drives, and will use hdparm
# to control them. Set this to 0 if you have /dev/sd devices and you want
# laptop mode tools to use the "sdparm" command to control them. 
#
